Dear {{username}},

We’re very happy to let you play around with the Zeega beta!

And we do really mean beta - there are bugs and many new features in development, but we really wanted to get this in people’s hands early. If you encounter issues, please let us know, as we love to know what’s working and what’s not!

Right now, our HTML5 editor works best in Chrome/Safari. To activate your account, go to:

All best and let us know if you have any questions!

- The Zeega Crew (Filipe, James, Jesse, Joseph, Kara and Lindsey)
