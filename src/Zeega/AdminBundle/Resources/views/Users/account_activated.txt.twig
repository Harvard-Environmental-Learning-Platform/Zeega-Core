Dear {{username}},

We’re very happy to let you play around with Zeega!

We are still in the process of making great tutorial videos and there are bugs, but we really wanted to get this in people’s hands early. If you encounter issues, please let us know, as we love to know what’s working and what’s not!

Right now, our HTML5 editor works best in Chrome/Safari. To activate your account, go to:
