## How to request access to Zeega

Zeega is still in a early development stage and we are currently working with a small group of partners. If you would like to receive project updates and get access to our private beta when it's ready, please sign up to our mailing list. We'll be sending out invites later this year to registered users. 


## For Developers

Zeega is currently in early alpha. The code is changing fast and is currently going through a refactoring push. If you want to install or extend Zeega check the developer resources from the [wiki](http://github.com/Zeega/Zeega-Core/wiki). 

If run into any issues or have any questions reach out on the [Zeega Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/zeega-dev).
